Respect your fucking craft. Think about all the fucking possibilities. This design is fucking brilliant. You won’t get good at anything by doing it a lot fucking aimlessly. A good fucking composition is the result of a hierarchy consisting of clearly contrasting elements set with distinct alignments containing irregular intervals of negative space. Fuck.

Your rapidograph pens are fucking dried up, the x-acto blades in your bag are rusty, and your mind is dull. Stop clicking your mouse, get messy, go back to the basics and make something fucking original. Nothing of value comes to you without fucking working at it. Fuck. Make your work consistent but not fucking predictable.

This design is fucking brilliant. Design as if your fucking life depended on it. Can we all just agree as the greater design community to stop fucking talking about Comic Sans altogether? It’s getting fucking old. Use your fucking hands. Think about all the fucking possibilities. Use your fucking hands.
